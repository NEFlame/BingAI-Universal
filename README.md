# BingAI-Universal
Chrome Extension Fork of User-Agent Switcher and Manager that allows for using Bing Chat in Google Chrome.

Spoofs user-agent string to 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/112.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/112.0.1722.48' only on www.bing.com. Tested in both Chrome and Brave.
Have not tested manually using the extension to edit the userstring, however if you wanted to do that, just download the main User-Agent Switcher and Manager extension. This fork is for people who want it to work out of the box for accessing Bing AI chat.

Simply go to chrome://extensions/ and drag the entire .zip into the window. Designed to just work, however, I haven't tested actually using the extension for manually changing user agents.
